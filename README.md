## 🔄 Syncing Your Fork (Stay Up to Date)

When the instructor updates the original repo, your fork won’t automatically update. Here’s how to stay in sync:

### 🌐 Option A: Sync on GitHub Website (easiest)

1. Go to **your fork** on GitHub.
2. If you see a banner saying:

   > “This branch is X commits behind `<InstructorRepo>`”
   > Click **Sync fork → Update branch**.
3. Done! Your fork now has the latest updates.

### 🖥️ Option B: Sync with GitHub Desktop

1. In **GitHub Desktop**, open your fork.
2. Go to **Repository → Repository Settings… → Remotes**.
3. Add a new remote called `upstream` with the instructor’s repo URL.
4. To update:

   * **Fetch upstream** (from the menu).
   * **Merge upstream/main** into your branch.
   * **Push origin** to update your fork on GitHub.
